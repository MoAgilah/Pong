# Pong

A minimalist Pong clone built to **demonstrate** usage of **SFMLEngine** â€” a backend-agnostic C++ engine core with an SFML backend.

This project exists to:

- Show how to structure a simple game on top of your engine  
- Validate interface design and engine usability  
- Serve as a reference for future projects like *SuperMarioWorldClone*

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals & Purpose

- Provide a clean, straightforward example of using **SFMLEngine**  
- Test engine subsystems (windowing, input, rendering, game loop) in a small, contained codebase  
- Help onboard new users by lowering the barrier to experimenting with the engine
